### Usage

```
./compile.sh

./bin/gtester // this will run the tests
```

### Results

<mark> Tested and efficient strings library implementatioon, the majority of code is covered with tests, checked by valgrind for memory leaks, as well as different compilers (clang and gcc) with the max level of warnings; pvs studio and sanitisers to ensure the quality of code </mark>

### Example of execution:
if you compile and run the main file along with the lib, you will get the following example of execution.
```
--------------- Show default funcs -------------------
String from cstr: Hello there!
Size: 12
Capacity: 12
My str empty: false

-------------- Show get and put chars ----------------
Getc: H
String before puts: Hello there!
String after puts: fello there!

Second string after copying first string: fello there!
Second string after clear: 
-------------- Show inserts ----------------
Second string after append cstr: String that was appended
Second string after inserting f at third position: Strfing that was appended

Second string after inserting ffff at third position: Strfffffing that was appended
Second string after inserting first string at third position: Strfello there!fffffing that was appended

------------- Show appends ----------------
First string: fello there!
First string after f has been appended: fello there!f
First string after ffff has been appended: fello there!fffff
Second string appended to the first one: fello there!fffffStrfello there!fffffing that was appended

------------ Show find ---------------------
First string: fello there!fffffStrfello there!fffffing that was appended
Index of l: 2
Index of there starting from 7-th character: 6
Index of l (find if): 2

------------ show read write to file ----------------
String: "Hello there, this shows the write file func" was written to the fileRead test file that was written to: Hello there, this shows the write file func
Read the file up to delim, that is in this case 'i': 
The next message is the example of write to the stdout
Hello there, this shows the write file func

------------ Show substr ---------------------
Initiali string: fello there!fffffStrfello there!fffffing that was appended
Substr of str (from 0 to 2, my_str_substr is used): fe
Cstr substr of str: fe

------------ Show cmp ---------------------
Cmp with my_str: -1
String: fello there!fffffStrfello there!fffffing that was appended; my_str: sdhfdsannjdhv
Cmp with cstr: 1
String: fello there!fffffStrfello there!fffffing that was appended; my_str: dksbhgslsajdhj
Cmp with another cstr: -1

String: fello there!fffffStrfello there!fffffing that was appended; my_str: omg
------------ Show other ---------------------
String before popback: fello there!fffffStrfello there!fffffing that was appended
String after popback: fello there!fffffStrfello there!fffffing that was appende
Capacity before reserve: 80
Capacity after reserve: 160
My str before resize: fello there!fffffStrfello there!fffffing that was appende
My str after resize: fello there!fffffStrfello there!fffffing that was appende00000000000000000000000
Capacity before shrink to fit: 160
Capacity after shrink to fit: 80

Note here that string is filled with zeroes after the resizeMy str before erase: fello there!fffffStrfello there!fffffing that was appende00000000000000000000000
My str after erase: fello ther0000000000
